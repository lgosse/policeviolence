JSO officers set up an undercover operation in the area and made contact with three people and attempted to make arrests. At that point, someone produced a gun, and the officers commanded for the suspects to drop the gun. (To be clear, the news report sounded as though multiple people were told to drop a single gun.) The people reportedly did not drop the gun. The officers shot and killed one person and wounded another.",
